 * Description:
 *              The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
 *                  14 = 2 × 7
 *                  15 = 3 × 5
 *              The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
 *                  644 = 2² × 7 × 23
 *                  645 = 3 × 5 × 43
 *                  646 = 2 × 17 × 19
 *              Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors. What is the first of these numbers?
